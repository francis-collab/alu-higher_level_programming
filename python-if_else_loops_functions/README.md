# Higher Level Programming - Python If/Else Loops Functions

## Task 0: Positive anything is better than negative nothing
This program assigns a random signed number to the variable `number` each time it is executed. The output states whether the number is positive, negative, or zero.

## Task 1: The last digit
This program prints the last digit of the random signed number stored in `number`. It describes the last digit as being greater than 5, equal to 0, or less than 6 and not 0.

## Task 2: I sometimes suffer from insomnia
This program prints the ASCII alphabet in lowercase, not followed by a new line. Only one print function and one loop are used.

## Task 3: When I was having that alphabet soup
This program prints the ASCII alphabet in lowercase, excluding the letters 'q' and 'e'. It follows the same constraints as Task 2.

## Task 4: Hexadecimal printing
This program prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and hexadecimal format, using only one print function and one loop.

## Task 5: 00...99
This program prints numbers from 0 to 99, separated by a comma and a space, with two digits each. The last number is followed by a new line.

## Task 6: Inventing is a combination of brains and materials
This program prints all possible different combinations of two digits, ensuring the digits are different and each combination is printed in ascending order.

## Task 7: islower
This function checks if a character is lowercase. It returns `True` if the character is lowercase and `False` otherwise.

## Task 8: uppercase
This function prints a string in uppercase, followed by a new line, using no more than two print functions and one loop.

## Task 9: print_last_digit
This function prints the last digit of a number and returns its value.

## Task 10: add
This function adds two integers and returns the result.

## Task 11: pow
This function computes a to the power of b and returns the value.

## Task 12: fizzbuzz
This function prints numbers from 1 to 100, replacing multiples of three with "Fizz", multiples of five with "Buzz", and multiples of both with "FizzBuzz".
